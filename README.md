This was a project I worked in midway through my JS course. This project contained much of what I was already familiar with through the fundamentals so it was a good reinforcement of what I learned.

Things I changed from the original project:
- the winner gets first turn for the next game
- if a player goes over the set score (currently 10) they lose

Things I learned:
- learned simple DOM manipulation such as displaying scores, changing CSS using JS and adding/removing classes from HTML elements
- learned how to set an active player and switch
- learned how to reset the game
- created a few functions to get this game to work properly
